		<h2> Wow! So much interesting information!</h2>
		<p> This page is created so that I can add an external link to my index.html. It has no other purpose other than it's purpose to serve as an external link. There is no topic for this page, and it is only for me to create a link so that Mrs.Keras knows I can create an external link. This page is only supposed to be a basic page for now. I do not care what information it has on it, as I do not wish to waste my time any further. This will be the end of this page, which sole pupose is to serve as an external link to my index.html. Thank you for reading this useless page which has no other purpose than to be an external link.
